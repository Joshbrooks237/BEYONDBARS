# 👦👧 Kids Mode - Helping Children Stay Connected

## Why Kids Mode Matters

**Every child deserves to stay connected with their parent, no matter what.**

### The Reality:
- **2.7 million children** in the US have an incarcerated parent
- Many are very young (under 10 years old)
- The existing prison communication systems are designed for adults
- Kids struggle with complex interfaces and compliance rules
- Fear of saying the "wrong thing" stops them from reaching out

### The Impact:
Children who maintain contact with incarcerated parents:
- Have better mental health outcomes
- Do better in school
- Are less likely to become involved in the justice system themselves
- Maintain crucial family bonds

**Kids Mode makes it safe and easy for children to tell their parent "I love you."**
