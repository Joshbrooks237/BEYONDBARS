# 🎤 Speech-to-Text Feature / Voz a Texto

## Why Speech-to-Text Matters

### The Reality:
Many people struggle with typing or literacy, but they have **powerful words to share**:

1. **Children** (ages 5-12)
   - Can't type well yet
   - Struggle with spelling
   - Express themselves better verbally
   - Get frustrated with keyboards

2. **Parents/Guardians with Limited Literacy**
   - May not be comfortable writing
   - English as second language
   - Want to express deep emotions
   - Have important things to say

3. **Elderly Caregivers** (Grandparents)
   - Unfamiliar with typing
   - Prefer speaking
   - Raised kids verbally
   - Technology can be intimidating

4. **Accessibility Needs**
   - Visual impairments
   - Motor skill challenges
   - Learning disabilities
   - Any reason typing is hard

**Speech-to-text removes the barrier. Your voice = your message.**
